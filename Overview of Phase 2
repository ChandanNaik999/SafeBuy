SAFE BUY

Phase 2

Phase 2 begins after the consumer successfully gets the list of the merchants.

There are two modes of delivery system available at the merchant side.
  ➔ Pickup
    ◆ Consumer has to select one of the two modes from the pickup.
      ● Consumer visits the shop and gets the items on his own.
      ● Consumer uses the third party for it.e.g Dunzo. 
  ➔ Deliver
    ◆ The merchant facilitates delivery on it’s own.

The consumer after selecting one of the merchants available to him sends the list of
items to the merchant.

The merchant then selects whether he wants to make the transaction or not.
If he wants to then he also informs about the mode of delivery.

If the merchant is only open for pickup or both and then if the consumer goes for the
pickup. Then the consumer has to make the decision from the two available modes of
pickup.
Otherwise if merchant is open for delivery and consumer goes for it merchant  will deliver it.
